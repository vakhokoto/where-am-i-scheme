Few advices for linux users:

To run the program I would recommend to copy the directory of kawa interpretator
and insert it in the top of files "where-am-i.scm" and "scheme-examples.scm"
in format "#![directory]" without brackets and quotes

after that run the command below so as to change the modification of the scheme files

    chmod +x where-am-i.scm
    chmod +x scheme-examples.scm

after that you can run program with the commands

    ./scheme-examples.scm - for scheme-examples.scm
    ./where-am-i.scm - for where-am-i.scm
